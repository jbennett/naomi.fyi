title: Mom, Mommy, Momma

Ever take note of how many roles you play, and subsequently how many hats you wear? I was thinking about that the other day. I have the responsibility of wife, mother, daughter, sister, aunt, friend, and that is just relationally! There is also the responsibility I have through volunteering. But today, I want to camp down on my role within relationships.

Relationships are work-it takes putting one hundred percent into something whether or not the other party does the same. And I am sure you have noticed, that if that effort is not put forth then the relationship tends to fizzle. However, I find the one relationship that is acceptable for the other individual(s) to not put the same effort forth is motherhood. Think about it, how many times a day do you pick-up clothes and toys or prepare and clean-up a meal? How much of your day is planned around their activities? And yet, you do not see them do the same for you haha. Is it any wonder why mommas are exhausted. Thankfully, other moms can relate, so there is not the same expectation of your time.

I do feel bad for my hubby many times because unfortunately, and even if I do not intend it, he gets the short end of the stick. My energy is so wrapped up in nursing, changing, cleaning, laundry and repeat. There is not much variation, and if you don’t do it than it just plain won’t get done. (Well there are the exceptions obviously, but as a stay-at- home mom, I have agreed to the above being my full-time job).

These past few weeks I have felt the responsibility a liitle more. We are potty training Timothy, and it really is a time sucker. The first week, we lived on our main floor because I don’t want him to be peeing on my carpet. We are now into week three and having more success, so slowly, I am resuming my normal pace of keeping up with the house. I have been feeling like I have cabin fever though...being house bound around a potty is just plain annoying :) No, I love the result of potty training not so much the process.

Additionally, it is like my kids conspired to not let momma get sleep at night. It has been quite common for me to get up at least four times a night. This momma appears to be needed at night almost as much as during the day. And it may be because it is getting darker sooner, but I find the nights seem a little more difficult. I know this is just for a time, so I really try to soak up all aspects of having young children....but I do look forward to having my sleep back again!

So what do I do when enter the mental space of condemning myself for not getting everything done, spending time with my husband, and finding a little time for myself to get refreshed? I look at pictures and videos of my favourite moments in my marriage and in the lives of those I love. It makes me smile, and it reminds me, that there is more to life than all my laundry being put in their drawers, the dishes being done, or my bathroom sparkling.

Why not join me? Remember when you are feeling like your hats are just too much for you to carry that you are doing better than you think, and the fact that you are noticing that areas that need improvement, means you are putting your effort forth into those tasks and those relationships. You. Can. Do. It.
