title: When our Hearts Hurt
---

This time of year for many is a time full of wonder and awe. Many are anticipating their whole families coming together and enjoying a beautiful meal, that maybe Grandma prepared. There is warmth and laughter at every corner of the house. And somehow there is peace and unity. For many, despite differences, that is the part of the joy of Christmas; that for 24 hours, people are capable to put aside their individual bent for community with each other.

But, I ask you, what happens if that isn’t your story? I have shared before that Christmas was such an amazing time in my house growing up. I can still remember the anticipation of that time of year: picking out our Christmas tree in a snow storm; watching my mom lace up the tree with lights; seeing my dad with his Christmas apron dancing and singing while making cookies. I can remember the excitement of thinking about what I would get each one of my siblings…something they would really like or something that they really needed. FYI it was a privilege to be able to get your presents out first….we just couldn’t wait to bless each other. It was my favourite. It was as some people say, “my happy place.” Especially when you add in that Jesus came from heaven to earth as a baby…to live, to teach, to disciple and die for me! Redemption is the greatest thing I could ever be given.

So again, what happens when those moments of hope, joy, happiness and anticipation fade? What happens if you have lost that person that was so tightly linked to those beautiful memories? Whether it be through a death or a dissolved relationship? What do you do? How to move past the sadness that comes?

I know so often I have been told to “move on…just leave those memories in the past.” And I get where those people are coming from. Yes, I need to make new memories with my husband and boys that will last their lifetimes. But leaving a part of you behind or trying to forget what once was so intrinsic in who you were, is more difficult.

This has been a reality for me the last few years. A very dear relationship of mine is no longer there, and each year when Christmas comes, it feels like a part of me has died. The joys and anticipation that come from decorating my trees and turning on my beloved Christmas carols, can in the same moment bring such heartache. Why? Because those memories of peace, laughter and joy also bring me sadness and tears simply because that is not reality. The person that was so dearly linked to those times has hurt my heart in a way that I cannot put into words. And so there is pain.

Now, with that being said, I do not want to remain here. I do not want that to taint every Christmas from here on out. And unlike those who have lost a beloved one, my families story is not done yet…there can be another redemption story…if the Lord can bring the dead back to life than he can certain change hearts.

So I am going to focus on the beauty that is Jesus this year. Will you do that with me? Let’s focus on how he came, he lived, and he died for you and for me. That he humbled himself to take the punishment for all sin. Let’s focus on the wonder of his love for us, and be in awe his majesty during this year and all the year through. Hallelujah, praise be to him now and forever!

Until next time.
