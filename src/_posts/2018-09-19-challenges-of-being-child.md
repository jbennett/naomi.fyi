title: The Challenges of Being a Child
---

I hope you are all enjoying your fall thus far. It is hard to believe that it is already three weeks into the school year (well here in Canada anyways :) I am sure that at your house, there are mornings that go smoothly and then mornings where it is all you can do to get your young one out the door with everything that (in my case) he needs!

We enjoy school and learning over here, so we are not surprised that Zackary has taken to it. He loves the social part and, shocker, he loves math-let’s set the record straight…that comes from his daddy. Well, with that being said, he has been having some boys picking on him. And this took place last year as well, but I thought that the individuals were younger than him and that this year it wouldn’t matter. So I told Zackary to just ignore it and find other kids to play with. Good idea right? He was part time, so we had him two days of the week so he went back charged. Weeellll, those kiddos are not in a younger grade and now they are with him everyday, all day, and the situation was not good.

I told him the same thing this year, to just walk away hoping that the boys would get bored, but as it turns out, they have perseverance as a quality haha. Anyways, after two weeks I decided to talk to his teacher. Gosh, did I feel like I was going to throw-up…no wonder my own little guy doesn’t like to tell when people are not being nice to him, I don’t like dealing with confrontation or anything that could bring it about.

Well, suck it up momma, right! All that is to say, I was extremely blessed with how the teacher received the information. What a fantastic lady. We are very thankful that he is in her classroom this year.

And the past week since I went in has been amazing. He comes home every day with a big smile on his face! Not only that, I mentioned how the transition to grade one has been a bit challenging because there is not as much time for creativity and running lol. And Zackary has an exuberant amount of energy! I said that I had been trying to encourage him to try out for Cross Country and Track and Field, but that he knew he wouldn’t be the best. I of course told him that we do things in life such as his running because we love it, not because we are going to get first. All that is to say, that later that day when he came home, the very first words out of his mouth was asking permission to try out. My reply was an enthusiastic, “OF COURSE!”

Later that night I asked if his teacher had asked him if he would, and he smiled and said, “yes.” It is refreshing to know that there are still teachers out there who are intentional about education our children and who truly take joy in knowing them as people; there likes, dislikes, challenges and strengths. I stand here, very optimistic about this coming year, and sooo thankful that God, even now, is giving us opportunities to show how He is looking after our little man.

Have a wonderful rest of your week!

I will be posting a recipe later this week….mmmm, fall feasting :)
