title: Ten Years of Weddedâ€¦?
---

On June 24th, Jonathan and I celebrated our ten year wedding anniversary!!! To say that sounds unbelievable. I do remember talking about it on our honeymoon that we would be still quite young when we approached this land mark in our lives...and here we are.

I have talked about our beginning and our wedding day in previous post (November 11, 2015) so I won't reiterate that, but there are things that I wanted to go more into more depth.

Marriage really is a beautiful image, isn't it? A man takes a wife and the two ride off into the sunset...a new adventure is before them and they are so full of hope and anticipation. It is beautiful. It is glorious...it is a picture of how wonderfully God created that union. And for me, I was hooked on that image. I have mentioned in other posts that my aspirations were to be a mom, and part of that dream was to meet the man of my dreams (it took me a few years, but after many crushes and years, I came around to the realization that it was Jonathan).

I use to think about that moment; what I would wear, the time of year, what location etc. I even dreamed about it-and without fail the moment before I would see the grooms face, I would wake-up! It was going to be one of the most amazing moments of my life. And just as I had hoped, it was.

Jonathan was my best friend...like best friend. The man had made it his part-time job to study me, to figure me out, so he knew me better than I knew myself (and I am not kidding about that...he can pinpoint my emotions before I can even come around to what they are). Our friendship was the best thing to bring into our marriage.

I always loved that, that is how we started. I think I mentioned that there was no initial physical attraction to Jonathan-I have spent many years debating people as to whether that is truly possible, which obviously for me, it is. But you know, I fell in love with his heart. He was always willing to offer his services for anything if it would help someone whether that was physical labour, or tutoring; he thought the best of people and treated them the same despite how they treated him back. His heart....super hot and sexy :)

The wedding day over, and our first year of marriage unfolding and many times I forgot about his amazing heart; I put aside his needs and his desires for our relationship. I was so focused on where money was going to come from, how I was going to manage my school load, how uncomfortably warm it was in our apartment (I tend to get ridiculously agitated when it is excessively warm temperature, which was a problem for the first six year of a marriage...hallelujah was on our tongues when we finally had some kind of air) that he honestly, in many regards, faded into the background. His voice would come to the forefront when he became angry, but due to my selfishness, I just tried to brush it off as his inability to see what I needed to accomplish. Now when I look back on it, all I can see is ugliness...me, Jonathan...the whole thing, ugly. No wonder he had more time by himself, and I had more fun with co-workers and friends. We went from enjoying each other and thinking the world of each other, to borderline hate of each other.

Years passed, we moved back to our hometown and things just continued to go downhill. Our careers were in a bit of a better situation (I was hired by a government office, and Jonathan started at a company for web development and software), but we were living with my brother-in-law, and it was just obvious to everyone we were miserable. And one summer night, after a very ugly fight...I walked out. I wish I could tell you that the details of that fight are faded, that I don't remember what was said, but I do...I remember his words that just pushed me over the edge.

I packed a bag, said nothing to him, and called my dad to come and get me. It was late, so I didn't want to talk about it with them when I got there, but I do remember turning our wedding picture down on its face so that I would not see it the next morning. I didn't see how we were going to be fixed. And I remember thinking, "better now when we are only 23 and have no children." And you know, I almost bought it.

I went to church the next day with my family and the pastor was speaking on marriage. He was preaching to the men, but I just remember having my heart tugged on. So I called Jonathan and said that we needed to talk. We went to a conservation area and I asked him to tell me from his perspective, what were our issues. And I just sat there, and listened to every word he said until he was done. It felt like an eternity, but I was faithful in keeping my mouth shut. And then it was my turn to divulge. And all I can say, is that it was two very broken people talking about very similarl issues, but from different sides.

We began counselling. It definitely helped. One of the major things for us to implement were date nights, which we had to become creative with as money was tight. And it is hard to believe that all this took place within just two years of marriage. It really makes me see how quickly relationships (marriage or otherwise) can fall apart. And it is only by the grace of God that we stayed together. And the beauty of his restoration in our marriage brings me to tears every time I take the time to reflect. And in His awesomeness, we now have two amazing sons. What a gift...not only did He show his hand in saving our marriage, but He so planned to allow us the honour of raising His boys. I am a blessed woman (which is something I encourage you to do...when the enemy comes in all the various ways he does, count your blessings...they stack-up against whatever lie is being thrown your way).

There have been many road blocks along the way...financial being one of them. There were times when our school loan payments a month was almost our entire income. And when I went on maternity leave with Zackary, we went $300 a week (as Jonathan put it) "into the hole." It was exhausting, working and now seeing anything come of it. Especially Jonathan, I don't think he slept more than three hours a night for almost five years! It was crazy...his health was terrible, and despite our date nights, we were well, you guessed it, not doing so hot.

Zackary's birth brought a lot of great things; for me a distraction of how little time Jonathan had to spend with me hehe, and two, a realization for Jonathan just how much his job was taking away from his quality of life. And the result, as I have mentioned in previous posts, was for us to take a giant leap of faith, and have him branch out on his own.

The beginning, as you may expect, was a little brutal. Lots of interiviews, trying to attract clients etc. It was during this period, that the Lord really began to impress on my heart to just thank Him. It was like, He wanted me to know that yes, He saw everything that had been going on in our lives for many years, but He just wanted me to focus on how amazingly He provides.

There was a moment when Jonathan and I were talking and he told me he wanted me to confess just how bad things were financially. I took a bit of a pause and responded by telling him, that I couldn't do it-that I had made a promise to God to just thank Him.

And you know, it was a miracle a few weeks later when Jonathan called me down to his office and showed me the offer he had received from an American company. It was more than I had been expecting. I remember going upstairs with Zackary in my arms and I began to just bawl. I told Zackary that "mommy was crying happy tears, and that we needed to thank Jesus right away."

From that point, God has provided opportunity after opportunity to Jonathan. There are times where there is a lull and Jonathan is eager for things to pick-up. And there have been a few times where I have started to almost go down the road of worry about money, and the Lord so gently reminds me to just thank Him. And I have to say, it has been so amazing to watch everything unfold.

So here we are ten years later...wow! We were able to celebrate by going to Ottawa (Cananda's capital, yay!). We are so thankful to our parents who took great care of our kids while we were away (they got spoiled with attention and treats) This is the second time we have been away (excluding our honeymoon) since we have been married. We had a lovely time exploring the city and having conversations about the future (without the demands of little children).

During one of our stops, we exchanged cards. I just wanted to share what Jonathan wrote to me. I cried. I do not think that I am deserving of such compliments, and normally I wouldn't, but I thought it would be appropriate as a lot of this post has to do with the fragility of our marriage in the past and how God worked a miracle:

_Naomi,_

_When we got married, uncle John said that I would be the steady anchor and you would be the sails that would push our boat to new and interesting places. He was only half right though._

_Naomi, you push the boat, but you are also such a support. You are so reliable and dependable that it truly blows my mind. I know with complete certainty that I wouldn't be where I am today, in any way, without you. You motivate and inspire me to be a better husband, father, businessman, and community member. You have given me more joy than I deserve and I cannot begin to thank you enough. Thank you for the 10 best years of my life, I am so looking forward to the next 60 + eternity. Love Always and Forever, Jonathan._

The last part always makes me laugh because we have an ongoing conversation as to whether the fact that we were married on earth is going to matter in heaven...he says it will, and I say we will be to busy on the fact that we are in heaven! Anyways, I transgress...I really wanted to show the transition. If you are sitting there and your marriage is in shambles, it is possible (with lots of work on your part and with wisdom from the Lord) to find that love that you had for each other when you were first married, and even more, to have that love exceed what you thought possible.

So in closing, I want to say what a tremendous blessing it is to call Jonathan both my best friend and husband. It has been great getting to know you better these past fourteen years, and I look forward to the years ahead xoxxo.
