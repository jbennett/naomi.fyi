title: "Happy New Year: Here We Come 2019!"
---

I am adding to this blog post a few days after I had written it, which is rare for me; usually I write and then edit a few times (over a series of days) and then post. But, I have been reading a book by Ann Voskamp called One Thousand Gifts, which has changed my thought process. In her book she speaks on the journey that she took to experience joy. Not the joy that we may experience when we receive an amazing gift, promotion or when on an adventure; rather, spiritual joy that is unleashed in our lives through thanksgiving.

As a result, I have revised my blog to exclude The Worst of 2018 section. I am now trying to change my point of view to watch for elements of thanks in every day…and I believe that applies for the year too. So without further ado, my previous thoughts on 2018 :) Enjoy.

Is it just me, or is anyone else having a super hard time believing that we are already embarking on a new year! I remember a co-worker telling me that you never truly realize how quickly time passes you by until you have children; I didn’t entirely believe him because I already felt the constant ticking of the clock, but he was right….you blink and it is the year that your baby turns two!

I was trying to think of the best and worst things that occurred in 2018-I am one of those people that like to reflect….almost to a fault. Reflecting did lead me to a conclusion that like my hubby, I really should start keeping a journal to remind myself of the year (he’s so good for that). And Lord knows, with my momma brain, I could really use the reminders. (Funny how before I had kids I could remember everything…even in university, I only wrote down when my assignments and exams were to see how much time I had to prepare for them…how times have changed :) Anyways, I digress….Behold my recap of 2018.

- Building a snow fort in February with the boys.
- Taking the boys sledding for the first time.
- Increased vocabulary and development of the boys (man a living, they really are entertaining).
- Seeing Les Miserable with some of my friends.
- Visiting Fraser, Sarah and Sebastian in Kentucky.
- My sisters telling me they are both expecting.
- Celebrating our twelfth anniversary by going to an aquarium and seeing Wicked.
- Zackary learning to ride a two wheeler.
- Miles’ first steps.
- Getting a pool pass for the summer (so many wonderful days splashing around).
- Timothy being brave enough to put his head under water at the beach and pool.
- Walks along the lake.
- The expansion of my vegetable garden (you should have seen how huge my cucumbers were, and how many tomatoes I got throughout the season).
- Zackary learning to blow bubbles with bubblegum.
- Taking the boys to the zoo for the first time (Miles literally jumped out of his stroller when he saw the gorilla).
- Being asked to work the election from my previous employer.
- Timothy’s first movie at the theatre.
- Decorating the outside of my door with garland and lights this year (thank you, dad).
- Establishing Christmas traditions with the boys.
- Hearing my boys tell each other they love each other, or that they see each other as best friends (melts the momma heart).

Sooo there you have it. There are many many more, but I thought I would keep it somewhat short and sweet. I hope you all have enjoyed reflecting and anticipating the new year. Praying many blessings for you in 2019.

Until next time….xoxxo
