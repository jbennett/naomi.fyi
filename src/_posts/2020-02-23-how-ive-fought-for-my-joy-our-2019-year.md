title: "How I’ve Fought For My Joy: Our 2019 Year"
---

I have started writing this blog post probably twenty times now, but I feel so vulnerable and exposed that I delete all content and walk away. Why? Because who wants judgment or condemnation to be projected on to themselves or the people they love so dearly. But, then I realize how writing is a cathartic experience, so I am just going to suck up the possible negativity and go for it.

I recently was chatting with a friend about how I have asked the Lord to give me supernatural joy; the joy that only comes as a result of following Him. Why? Why would I make such a request? Well, because without the joy that only the Holy Spirit can provide, I don’t know how you survive life.

There are many things in this life that provide temporary happiness: accomplishing goals, getting the perfect position, meeting your spouse, having children, financial success, vacations of a life time etc. And I have experienced such highs as a result of the above, but these things are fleeting. Once you have been in that relationship for many years, or are not able to advance any further in your position, or you are struggling to pay the bills…your joy may not be there. When we allow our circumstances to be based on what is happening in the physical world, we will struggle.

How do I know this? Well, I have fought to keep my joy and hope in the Lord many times throughout my life. But over the last two years I have felt like a fight to the death for my joy.

Jonathan is self employed and as such there is no regular pay cheque, so from month to month we can see a drastic difference in income. Which honestly, is what it is, and I know that he is very dedicated and self-motivated, so I don’t worry about him not putting himself out there enough or making contacts. But, the last few years have been filled with many “almosts.” I cannot tell you the countless amounts of times that proposals have been given or companies saying that they want to do this or that with him, and then…..waiting….. It is exhausting. And as if this reality isn’t challenging enough to keep hope and joy, then there was Jonathan’s diagnosis of type 2 diabetes.

It was. not entirely a surprise, for we both knew that this was a reality of years of weight gain with lack of sleep combined with stress and other life choices. But, the devastating part is that he was making significant changes to his lifestyle that were leading to amazing weight loss results, and then, bam, diabetes. Since then, it has been a continuous concern and stress in my life. Seeing how his skin heals slower, his circulation is slow etc. etc. So often I give myself distractions because if I sit to think about it, and how I am limited in terms of ways to implement change, I begin to feel like a part of my heart is breaking.

So, at this point, I don’t have a silver-lining or how I am seeing the Lord work in this situation. I just keep reminding myself that He is in it, and He knows what He’s doing, and whether I see it or not, it is with my best in mind.

If you could just remember us in your prayers, and cover my hubby with prayers for healing and endurance as he continues his weight loss journey, it would mean so much to me.

Update:

Ok, so above I mentioned how I didn’t know how God is working in the midst of our situation, well, shortly after I began writing this post, God showed us one of the ways.

My brother-in-law is a Optometrist in the States and he told my sister that there has to be a varying price range for the diabetes medication because he seems diabetics with a wide range of incomes at his clinics. So that brought me to start searching: I called the pharmacy and they said that there wasn’t much they could do because the drug was new, and therefore, there was no generic version. Alright, so then I called our doctors office. They said that Jonathan should come in to speak to the doctor. I decided that I would tag along for that appointment. As the doctor was about to head out the door I asked about the medication cost. AND THEN, it felt like God opened a big door… since our doctor is an American and has practiced in the States, he has an I.D. number for us to fill the subscription in the U.S. He said that we would need to shop around, but for many of the medications, we may be able to find them for free. We came home, and I immediately started to make phone calls to all the pharmacies over the border. After we did our calls and research, Jonathan found that if we had a subscription to one of the pharmacies, it would save us hundreds of dollars. So after church we made a trip as a family over the bridge; after the script was filled and the price was given it came to a grand total of $6 American dollars!!!! Are you kidding me?! I cried. We get that our situation will be different as Jonathan loses the weight, but while we are on route, we now will not have the added burden of expensive medication. God is good in everything…even medication.

Additionally, we have seen a tremendous improvement in the swelling and redness in his legs. It has been such a blessing. And with everything, we continue to bring everything before Jesus in prayer.

Praying you are all experiencing the joy of the Lord… because it is our strength (Nehemiah 8:10).

Until next time xoxoxo
