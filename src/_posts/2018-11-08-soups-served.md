title: Soup's Served
---

I love the fall; it is tied with winter for my favourite time of year. I love the crisp smell in the air, the brightly coloured leaves falling against the dark backdrop of a rainy sky. I love the sound of the leaves crunching underneath my feet as I walk. It is beautiful. It is comforting. However, despite my sentimental attachment to the fall, there is one thing that I could do without that seems to surround it…colds.

We had our first round of colds through our house at the end of September. I decided that I was going to do all that I could to usher the colds out fast. I know many people have tricks that they swear by: Vicks on the bottom of the feet, apple cider vinegar and water, vitamins, ginger tea. I have found many of these to be useful…apple cider vinegar despite its nasty taste and ginger boiled in water with honey is probably my favourites. But, getting your kiddos to drink apple cider vinegar is, well…not a pleasant experience :) Sooo, this time round I went and found recipes of soups…lots and lots of soups. To the point where Zackary asked me the one night why we were having soup again. I prepared seven nights of soups. It made the menu fairly easy haha.

So below are some of my favourites from that week. And it may have been the timeline that we were at the mercy of the cold, or maybe it really was the soups helping, but by the end of the week we were free and clear.

I hope you try some of these recipes and enjoy!

**Crockpot Mexican Chicken Soup**

- 2 lbs boneless/skinless chicken breasts
- 1 large jar of salsa (I like PC extra chunky)
- 15 oz of organic chicken broth
- 8 oz of cubed Monterey Jack cheese

Place the chicken in the crockpot.

Next put add the salsa, followed by the chicken broth.

I like the layer ofcheese on top at the every end. And then if I feel like there is room for more…I add more :)

This soup is super simple and amazing. We had it with a side of raw veggie sticks. I think that topping it with avocado would be a nice treat too.

**Cauliflower Soup**

- 1 large head of cauliflower cut into smaller sections
- 1 medium carrot
- 1/4 cup celery, chopped
- 4 cups organic chicken broth
- 3 TBS butter
- 3 TBS flour (I use a gluten free almond base flour)
- 3/4 tsp salt
- 1/8 tsp pepper
- 2 cups milk (2% or homogenized)
- 1 cup shredded old cheddar cheese

In a large pot place the cauliflower, carrot, celery, and chicken broth. Bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer until soft, about 15 minutes.

In a large saucepan, melt butter. Stir in the flour, salt and pepper until smooth. Gradually add the milk. Stir constantly until thick, between 2-5 minutes. Stir in cheese until melted. Blend the cauliflower and other ingredients until smooth, add to saucepan and stir.

And there you go, soup is served!

**Paleo Chicken Tortilla Soup**

- 2lbs boneless, skinless chicken breasts
- 1 28 oz can of diced tomatoes
- 4 cups organic chicken broth
- 1 purple onion, diced
- 1- 2 jalepenos, de-seeded and chopped finely
- 2 cups carrots, diced
- 2 cups celery, diced
- 1 bunch of cilantro finely chopped
- 4 cloves of garlic, minced
- 2 TBS tomatoes paste
- 1 tsp chilli powder
- 1 tsp cumin
- Sea salt and black pepper for taste
- 1-2 cups water.

I added all the ingredients into the slow cooker and cooked on low for 8 hours. It is amazing! Like most crockpot meals, you can cook on low from 6-8 hours or high for 4-6 hours. The kids added bean chips in it. It is a welcomed meal at the end of a long and cool day! I hope you give it a try.

Until next time.
