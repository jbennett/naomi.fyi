title: Baby Boy Coming Early 2017!
---

Well, needless to say that I have not been doing well at keeping up with my blogging especially since my last post was about our anniversary trip! Many things have taken place since then...the biggest thing being that we are expecting our third baby...another baby boy!!! I am a week away from six months.

It was an unexpected surprise in the sense that it happened after only a few months of "trying." I remember being shocked when I saw the strip turn pink; with our oldest it had taken four months to conceive, and our second seven, so we had discussed that we would give it a year and if we did not become pregnant than we would accept and be happy with our family of four. So when the strip turned colour, I went straight to my bed, knelt down and began to cry. I thanked the Lord for allowing us another opportunity to bring another baby into the world. And the prayers continued to flow, and have continued to this day.

The first trimester was all about survival; I was nauseous from noon until bedtime, and there was absolutely nothing that would ease the symptoms. And with two little boys running around, there was not much time for rest. Thank goodness, Timothy still napped and Zackary was content with being allowed to watch a movie. That at least provided a smidge of downtime. Of course, I am tremendously thankful to my wonderful husband, who was willing to take over dinners- opening the fridge door would send me running to the sink or the bathroom. BUT, once we made it through that, for the first time I have some energy to spare :)

Now the name picking has begun, and my goodness, it is not so easy. There are about three or four names that we keep going over, and I can see him with any of the above. Jonathan is pretty set on two of them, and the one seems to be more and more in the lead every time we bring up the subject, which leads me to think it will be the winner. I like to let him have the final say...especially since I will be happy with any of the name.

I will keep you posted when we finalize, but just as a warning, we won't be revealing his name until he arrives...leave just an element of intrigue.
