title: Midwinter Blues

Where did you go? You may ask. And the answer is, I have been knee deep in laundry and on my knees scrubbing and disinfecting every bathroom and surface of my home. A stomach bug hit, and it hit hard.

I am trying not to complain about the fact that this winter has brought us more bugs than I can count (majority respiratory). The coughs and runny noses have had us outnumbered. I thankfully, only had two colds (one however, would go away for a few days and then ramp up). And then, on a cool Valentine’s Day, Zackary came to me declaring that his tummy hurt.

It had been a few hours since we had had anything to eat, and with their metabolisms, I was hoping for hunger being the culprit. I mentioned that hunger could be the reason and he agreed. But then about twenty minutes later, he returned stating this time, that it “really hurt.” Oh no, I thought for a quick minute, but then reassured myself that I should not jump to the worst conclusion. I asked him if he felt like he had to vomit. His answer made me realize that we had not ever gone through a stomach bug due to illness. He just looked at me and said, “I don’t know what that feels like.” When he was two we went to the hospital because he had been throwing up every night for a week, but it was due to the development of his gastrointestinal track not a bug...and him being two, he doesn’t remember.

So I told him to go and lay down on the bean bag for a minute and see if it subsided....but with that he puffed his cheeks and I just knew...run! I quickly grabbed him and we ran to the bathroom. And no sooner had we lifted the lid did he begin to throw-up. It was so sad...honestly, I think it is one of the worst feelings as a mom not being able to remedy that.

His sessions continued about every fifteen to twenty minutes for the next four hours. Timothy was shocked and kept asking what was going on. He seemed fine, and scowed down his dinner. BUT, about an hour or so after being in bed, I heard him in his room. I turned the light on to see him absolutely covered in well, dinner. I called for Jonathan and as we were discussing the best way to clean him and the bed up, he gave a heave and we knew we had to get him to the bathroom quick. I told Jonathan to grab his legs and I would hold his arms, but Jonathan told me to move, and in one movement, he had Timothy. Oh how gross the aftermath of these types of parenthood adventures ;)

After clean-up was taken care of, Jonathan and I began to discuss the necessities that would have to be in the house over the next few days. I began to feel a little unsettled, but I thought that it was because I taken care of way more undigested items than I would like (none being my preference).

We finished our list and as Jonathan began to gather his shoes and coat I ran to the washroom and was sick myself. Urg, is all I have to say about that. And it was looking promising for Jonathan, which was nice because then the rest of us would have someone to take care of us....but alas, he did not escape. By 2am, he also was unwell. It was, as they say, a family affair!

Thankfully, it was short lived. And due to a wonderful friend, I did not have to cook over the next few days-her soup was exactly what was needed for recovery.

Now we are back into respiratory colds...but after all that, I am thankful that it is a cold.

And we will make it through this!

Praying you are all staying healthy.
Until next time, xoxxo
