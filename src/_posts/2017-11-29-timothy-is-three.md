title: Timothy is Three!!
---

Do you ever sit there and wonder where time has gone? I have been doing this quite a bit lately (maybe it is because we count each month that Miles has been with us or because I have been running into former teachers), but today I really have been thrown aback. Timothy turned three! My blonde haired little man turned three!!

It really seems like yesterday that he came into this world. I had no idea how many tears would be shed of fear, sadness, joy and praise over this boy. The first year was brutal; pumping every three hours for nine months to make sure that he had breast milk definitely took a tole, and then all the appointments leading up to his surgery and the fear associated with that. And of course, the unknown of the road ahead with his hearing, speech and learning. I was a mess....hormones are not so merciful.

But God had Timothy in his hands, and Timothy’s life would further show us what a loving Father He is. (If you would like to know the full details of Timothy’s birth, cleft palate and the updates see previous posts).

We had another hearing assessment on the 17th of this month; I was able to get us on a cancelation list, and it worked out perfectly that my parents were available to come and entertain Zackary and Miles while we were with the audiologist. I was concerned that his hearing was not great prior to and following his strep throat. In particular because he was saying, “what?” If he could not see my lips. I am happy to say that his hearing is great. He still can hear the lower register better than the upper (which is probably why he can hear Jonathan better than me), but no cause for concern. They are so impressed with his hearing that they do not think he will need a second pair of tubes and they are not going to schedule him for another assessment for a year!!! (We had been going every 4-6 months). I tell you there was a hallelujah chorus being heard on that day ;)

And now for just focusing on Timothy!

Timothy Micheal, I love your sweet cheeks... I have said from the moment you were born that they were just so kissable, and I stand by that! You are intelligent: you blow us away with how many letters of the alphabet you know without any formal teaching. You are affectionate: you have to give everyone a hug-like the cashier in Carters last week (sure, just sneak behind the counter and give her a hug, sure, no big deal lol). You are so friendly: no person passes by you without a “hello” or “how are you doing?” You seek friendship with Zackary-always working with him in whatever scenario he has concocted in his imagination. You are caring: you always make sure that Miles has a toy or a hug if he is starting to get eager for mommy’s attention. Your passion for trains, rockets and music is amazing! (However, I will admit that you picking random single words in a song such as “hey” for the title does leave me puzzled).

We just love you to pieces, and I pray that your sweetness and gentleness of heart continues throughout your life (just maybe don’t go hugging cashiers forever ;) I pray that you use your passions and giftings for God’s purposes, and that you follow His word all your days.

Happy third birthday!

And just for fun. The top three things you will hear Timothy say in a day/sing:

1. Jingle Bells (Zackary sang it to Timothy whenever he would get upset as a baby and it has stuck lol).
2. I looovvve youuu (totally wish I had a recording of how he says it).
3. “I’m ok.” (He is pretty awkward in his movements still, so he tends to fall over or run into things kinda regularly hehe).

Until next post!
