title: Slow Cooker Chicken Pot Pie
---

Let me just start with a disclaimer, that unless you want to be making this meal on a weekly basis, do not read any further! Since I have made this, my man, asks for it regularly or gets super pumped when he smells and sees it cooking in the pot. (Not going to lie to you, it definitely makes me feel like I have arrived as a wife…I have reached the peak of success hahha).

I found this recipe probably about six months ago when I was craving pot pie, but didn’t want to have the crust due to gluten sensitivities over here. And when you take out the gluten, as you probably are aware, pie crust and breads tend to fall apart or crumble. Low and behold, there is someone who must have heard my hearts calling because right there on my computer screen was the recipe I was hoping for!

And now, I bestow it to you…and say, good eatings!

**Slow Cooker Chicken Pot Pie:**

- 4 lbs boneless, skinless chicken breasts
- 2 (12 oz or 400 ml) bags of frozen veggies. (I use a mixed melody of carrots and peas because I cannot eat corn).
- 1 stick of butter
- 4 cups of chicken broth (this was a really great way to use the broth that I had frozen from both a chicken and turkey).
- 1 TBS of garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, salt and pepper.

First, If desired, make your homemade chicken soup: melt the one stick of butter on the stove over medium heat. Once that is melted, add your spices. Quickly stir all together, then add your four cups of chicken broth and one cup of flour. Now this is where you are gonna need a little bit of muscle :)

You are going to stir constantly for 3-5 minutes until the soup reaches the thickness that you desire (could not think of another way to phrase that lol).

Pour the mixture over 4 lbs of boneless, skinless, chicken breast. Add the bags of veggies and give a stir. You can also add more veggies …there is seriously no reason to skimp out on those!

Cooking Time: If your chicken in thawed than you can cook the meal on high for three hours, remove the chicken and shred or cut into chunks, place it back in and cook for another half hour or hour (you can taste and leave the remaining time to your own preference). And there you have it!

I have made biscuits before and placed them on top, but the majority of the time we eat as it is. it is amazing, filling, and really, there isn’t too much to be said in the way of leftovers…..BUT everyone leaves very satisfied.

Highly, highly recommend this one! Happy eatings!
