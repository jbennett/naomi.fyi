title: Zackary Turned Siz!
---

It is amazing how quickly time can go whether or not you are taking note of it. I like to think that I am the type of person that conscientiously takes note of events (ordinary and extraordinary) in my life, but it still seems like no matter how intent you are, life has a way of surprising you. And that is how I felt putting six birthday candles of my baby boy’s birthday cake.

Your mind can’t help but travel back in time to those moments leading up to and including the day that you gave birth. And how it can feel like yesterday is amazing; it is as if your body grows older, but your mind stays fresh (especially for those moments). The day Zackary came into the world is definitely one of those moments that I believe my mind will always stay young.

It started as a beautiful, sunny and hot May day in 2012...my birthday in fact. After work, Jonathan and I headed to my parents for a birthday dinner (lasagna and DQ ice cream cake for dessert). It was absolutely wonderful! We even discussed when we thought that I would have baby since he wasn’t due for another four weeks. We all believed he would come early, but little did we know, that it would only be hours before his grand entrance!

Jonathan took me home after dinner and went to band practice. I decided to lay down because I was super tired. When Jonathan returned from band, I woke and just felt strange. I went to the washroom a few times and then began to feel what I imagined were contractions. Next thing I heard and felt a pop, and my water broke. I had not even packed my hospital bag, so the next while I began to get into a panic about getting essentials and leaving for the hospital.

When we arrived there the oncall paediatrician wanted to tell me all the possible things that could be wrong with a premature baby...I told her that I didn’t want to hear it unless we had to go down that road. At that moment I was already anxious about him coming early and I wanted to be at peace while going through labour. I won’t go into the remaining details, but in less than five hours, there was my beautiful little boy: Zackary Gabriel Bennett, 6 pounds 1 ounce, 21.5 inches long.

I can remember how my heart instantly felt so much love for that little baby. How I knew that I wanted to protect him; my desire to raise him to be a man who loved the Lord; a boy that would respect authority, honour those around him; a man that would cherish, love and respect his wife, and be a super stellar dad. I knew that I had a long and hard task ahead of me as being a parent, but in those few moments with him, I knew it was going to be the greatest task of my life.

My amazing boy, I love your energetic zest for life. I love how you use your imagination to build amazing creations. I love that you care so much for your younger brothers. I love that you sincerely care for people and are beginning to see and desiring to meet the needs of those around you. I love how much you love school, and learning! I love you.

Daddy and I look forward to seeing what you accomplish this next coming year. I just want to remind you to not expect perfection from yourself, but do your best in all things. Lord continue to bless you my beautiful boy.

Xoxxo,
Mom
