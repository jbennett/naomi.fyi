title: "Here Today, Gone Tomorrow: Reflections of 2017"
---

Reflection is such a fantastic and necessary part of life, especially when we are able to take a deep look at ourselves and our circumstances and learn something. Reflection that invokes change can take many different forms...and I find that most people tend to take note at the end of the year, typically resulting in some form of New Year’s resolution.

I used to not commit myself to resolutions because I hated watching how people would stay focused for a total of five seconds and then justify their fallback. I didn’t want to be part of that. As a result, I would make changes throughout the year and make sure they were goals that were attainable, so that I wouldn’t get weary. However, this year, I am going to reflect and make some changes now...making it feel a bit like a resolution.

2017 was a wonderful and horrible year all rolled into one tight package. Wonderful due to the birth of our son Miles, and God’s continued provision for Jonathan’s business (which allowed us to be more generous than we ever thought possible); and it was horrible for the continued unraveling of family relationships and the passing of our precious niece (watching the heartbreak and not being able to console my sister has been one of the hardest experiences of my life). I think this is the first time in my life that I felt no sentimental attachment to the year.

I know a large part of my lack of sentimentality was because so much negative was attached to the last six months of the year...and I know that isn’t right...that I should focus on all the positive....and I try, but if I am honest, I just don’t want to. I want to sit here and cry. I want to yell, “I am not okay...it is not okay!” I am tired and weary this beginning of 2018. I feel drained. I am not the person I desire to be.

So what I am gonna do with 2018? What is my approach gonna be? Well, I have realized in regards to relationships, that I really need to learn boundaries. I am the type of person that would love for everyone to know everything about me, to have everyone super close, but I have learned (this year in particular) that it cannot be that way. That there are people who will use things against you and your children...that people will slander you and the ones you love to those they are in community with. And as much as I wish I could change them, I cannot, so face value it will be. This approach is hard for me because it feels superficial, that I almost feel like it is better to not have relationship, but....

Furthermore, I need to learn to be more optimistic. I’m gonna be 33 and I still struggle with focusing on the good and the positive. It is so easy for me to be pulled into a state of worry, fear and negativity. I may not look like it when I am out and about, but leave me in my room by myself and well...it is not nice hahah. Here’s praying 2018 is the beginning of a change in this department!

I pray that 2018 is an amazing year of progress towards your goals. I pray that God meet you where you are, and speak His incredible truths into your life. I pray that He does “immeasurably more than you could ever ask or imagine” (Ephesians 3:20). Many blessings!
