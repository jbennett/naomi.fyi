title: "Timothy Update: Second Speech Assessment"
---

A few weeks ago, Timothy had his second speech assessment in London. We were informed of the appointment a few days prior, which meant that I was going to be traveling and attending the appointment with both boys. I was really praying that everything behaviourally with the boys would be wonderful as well as the weather conditions.

Both could not have been better; the boys did remarkably well during the drive and the rain did not start until we were at the hospital.

This was Zackary's first time coming for the speech, and I knew he wa going to be super excited when he walked into the waiting area. They have everything that would draw a child's attention: a play house, train track table, books, computer, t.v, blocks, shopping carts etc. Zackary, of course, zoned in on the train tracks...shocking, I know :)

We did not have to wait that long for the specialist to call us to the room. There, again, are many toys in the room, so that they can observe the child play-interaction with those in the room as well as the toys is key at this stage because it is a little difficult to expect a two-year-old to answer every question you ask them.

The specialist and the nurse were very impressed with how he continuously informed me of what he was playing with, as well as bringing it to them as well. The specialist indicated that many children who are born with cleft palates tend to be quiet and a little antisocial. So right there, he got two thumbs up. They also remarked on how chatty he was- I laughed, I think big brother and myself really contribute to that aspect haha. (I would be lying if I did denied the fact that, if I was going to get in trouble at school, it was because I was talking too much).

Finally, I was asked questions about the different sounds that he has been making with his word formation. Thankfully, he has touched on all of the consonants and vowels.

The appointment was a great success in all aspects! The specialist said that since she has no concerns with his speech development, we do not need to come back for another assessment until next year. What a tremendous blessing!

I made sure to touch on what the doctor said about Timothy with Zackary as we headed back to the car- the enforce how thankful we were to the Lord for all the ways He has wowed us these past two years with Timothy's development. He agreed.

And as a reward, the boys got their favourite snacks as well as a Christmas movie on the way home. It made for a quiet and blissful drive back home, where we would be able to tell daddy and family all the exciting news!
