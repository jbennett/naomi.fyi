title: The Stay-at-Home Mom
---

I can still remember being in grade nine and my Math teacher asking me what I wanted to be when I grew up. My answer, what was in my heart, was a mom; it had always been the only thing that I truly ever desired. And yes, I can still remember her facial expression in response to my answer; like a parent looking at their child and wondering why on earth they did something, only to realize it is because they are still investigating and learning about the world around them. What followed should not have surprised me because it is what an educator (whether parent or otherwise) does...she dashed my hopes (exaggerating of course) and told me what I should do: she told me that with my gifts and abilities academically, that I should not settle; that I should be a mother, if I so desired, but that should be complementary to my real career.

My stomach sank. My heart hurt. I felt confused. Was committing my life to a family, and solely a family, wrong? Was it insufficient, not commendable or even noteworthy? Like any young person, I internalized that comment and began my search for what I should do with my life.

We all have our thing right? Well for me, that was school. Yes, I rocked it! I enjoyed school to it and always looked forward to learning. I memorized and recalled dates like it was my job. It shouldn't be a surprise that I pursued the career of being an educator, a high school English and History teacher specifically. I moved stay-at-home mom from my primary goal to secondary.

I went for it, and I studied my behind off. But you know what I ended up coming back to, and ultimately pursued and attained through the grace of God, stay-at-home mom.

The Lord made it possible when many years ago it wasn't. To have Jonathan making enough to be sole provider, was not in the realm of possible. But God is awesome! How he takes the desires of our hearts, even desires that we've buried so deep that they've been forgotten, and can breathe life into them, is amazing. I stand here in awe of how he took our financial situation and turned it around (in another post I can go into detail of how our act of faith opened the door to so many blessings).

I was reminded the other day by the Lord of how I got here, how He led me, to the place I was told was not sufficient. I want to encourage the stay-at-home mom; you may have heard it from family and friends that being a stay-at-home mom is easy, or you may have heard the "oh" after being asked what you do for a living. Don't for a minute discount the role that you have been assigned. God has given you the task of "guard(ing) what has been entrusted to your care" (I Timothy 6:20). You are an educator, not just in a specific subject matter; you are building the foundation of your children's character and personality; you are creating an environment of love and affection that can't be replaced; you are showing them that they are precious to you, so precious that you have decided to make that "sacrifice" of self, for them and your family.

That is a noteworthy vocation.
