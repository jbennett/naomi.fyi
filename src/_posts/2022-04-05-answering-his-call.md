title: Answering His Call
---

I don't know if you are like me, but I like to have certain parts of my life planned. I don't, to the dismay of my husband, time block or journal and outline the timeframe of my goals, but I have a general idea mapped out in my brain. So when life throws me curve balls, I can have an internal meltdown or begin to analyze the garbage out of my perceived options. Like many of you, COVID threw me a very large curve ball.

I still remember the converesation-we had just had our youngest son, and with what seemed like days, my husband was asking me what I would like to do when the little man was in school. Good grief, as if I knew more than feeding, changing and napping schedules at that point in time; with a new born and two toddlers, it was all you could do to have supper on the table at dinner hour. Fast forward three years and I began to think about it. And I had banked down on entering the workforce again.

I had resigned when our second little guy was born, and decided to devote myself to the home (which had been my dream as a little girl). But then the fall before COVID my previous employer had asked me to come and work a day a week. It was perfect! It allowed me to get out of the house, put on my business attire and interact with real life adults!!!! Of course, it was in this environment that I began to think about part-time work and what that would look like for myself and our family as a whole. I began to get excited. And then in one swoop, COVID knocked me down to the ground.

In addition to my position not being needed with working from home, I switched gears again, dealing with, what felt like the absolute chaos when the kiddos got home from school. When I refer to those days as a flaming mess, I'm not joking. My middle guy in particular took so poorly to the protocols that it would take me hours each night, to calm him from his full blown panic attacks. It was halfway through the school year that, with saddened hearts, we pulled our boys from their school. So now, I was momma and teacher.

This was temporary, we kept telling ourselves and our friends: to get through the remainder of the school year and then return when the country and the educational system worked through the kinks. BUT, this is where God really began to mess with my plans.

I still remember the Lord asking me to do it for longer...to commit myself to another year of homeschooling. Now don't get me wrong, I love homeschooling, my mother homeschooled me and my siblings for a few years when I was growing up, and I didn't want to go back to school...it was that great! But that was then, this was now, and it was my kids. Boys, as Priscilla Shier would say are "noise covered in dirt." Yup. Well, my kids thankfully, don't like to get dirty, but noise...they have mastered that component. So I began to deflect and ignore the calling.

I told the Lord all my reasons why I shouldn't: having a separation between mom and school teacher is a good thing; I am not a seasoned early elementary teacher; it's good for them to have other authority figures; interactions with peers on a daily basis etc etc etc. The list was extensive. But when it got down to it, the biggest reason, the number one reason, was that I wanted to launch myself back into work. I wanted to have some part of my existence to be about me, rather than about the kids and their schedules, their needs etc. And I hear you, this is hard for me to even write and admit because it sounds so selfish.

And then one Saturday morning while sitting on the beach watching the boys in the water with Jonathan, God reminded me of Moses. And how God asked Moses to go to Egypt, and Moses hit God with his excuses. And what did the Lord say to Moses? "I am" is sending you (Exodus 3:14). God would equip Moses in the calling, he didn't call him when he was already equipped. And with that moment my heart softened and I cried. I had been telling God all the reasons why "I" couldn't do it, but I had never factored in, that if this is what my Lord and Saviour had for me for this time, than he would give me everything I needed to fulfill the calling.

And here we are, 1.5 years into homeschooling. It's still a journey, and I have to keep telling myself that ultimately Jesus has the say, and like Moses, he will direct me. I just have to be faithful to bring everything before him and lean on him alone.

So when he calls, will you answer? Will you lay down your excuses, concerns and fears and surrender to the Lord who has great plans for you (Ephesians 2:10)? He's waiting.

Until next time,
