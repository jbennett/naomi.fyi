title: Swimming, Swimming…When Days are Hot & Cool
---

I don’t know if you are like me, but many times when people say they are going swimming, I think of that song I used to sing when I was little: “Swimming, swimming in a swimming pool. When days are hot, when days are cool, in a swimming pool. Breast stroke, side stroke, fancy diving too....” It’s funny what words trigger a response in your brain haha.

I was always a fish. I was the first one in the water and the last one out...sometimes I wonder if my parents felt like they had to drag me out! If I could have been at the pool or beach every day in the summer, I would have, which is probably why we have been living at one of those this summer, and thankfully, my boys seem to be on the same track as their momma.

We live by the water so being able to swim is a very big priority for me. Which is why each summer the boys do two weeks of swimming lessons. This year was the first year that Timothy did not have me accompany him. I wasn’t sure how that would go, but he did just fine (except for the days that were cold...on those days he cried the whole time he was in the water). That was not exactly pleasant. I acutally had to leave the one day because he wouldn’t settle...between the cooler temperature and his falling and scuffing his knee, there was no calming him-Miles and I missed out on the tot and mommy swim. Besides the cool days it went off beautifully. I noticed that I really enjoy watching my kids have fun in the water. Do you think that is because I am watching them do something that always gave me such pleasure? Maybe that is why parents tend to force certain things on their kiddos...haha, in this cause I would almost argue, “too bad,” if they didn’t want to learn because the alternative of not knowing how to swim could yield catastrophic results.

This morning was kinda an eye opener in that respect. I went for a walk along the water with a friend of mine with our kiddos and it was hot, so I told the boys that we would get our feet wet at the end of the walk before heading home. I should have known that saying feet was unrealistic lol. There they both went up to their knees and inevitably, they both fell in. Ok, well now that you are both soaked, go ahead and splash around. Well, Zackary decided to go out a little bit and then turn around to the shore and show how he has learned to float and do his front glides. After seeing Zackary do that, Timothy decided to do the same thing, except he pushed out to the deeper water than the shore. All I saw was his little head go under and I handed Miles off to my friend and dashed into the water. He knew enough to push off the beach floor back to the shore, so that was good, but man, talk about a rush of Adrenalin. After that I reminded him, that he didn’t have his puddle jumper on and so it was different than when he did. Amazing what they become accustomed to and then don’t necessarily think about. Better that we had that conversation now then when we go to the beach again or even the pool.

Being in the water has been a life saver because we all have a great time, but it also burns their energy in a way that gives us down time afterwards.

What is your summer time treasure? Do you spend time at the camp ground, going to amusement parks, splash pads etc?

I pray you are all having a healthy and happy summer. It is unbelievable with how quickly it passes!
