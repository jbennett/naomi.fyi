title: The Nitty Gritty

I have thought about you all often over the last few weeks, and I just didn’t bring myself to sit down and write. Partly due to laziness, and partly due to the fact that I have been dealing with many different issues on my end...many being parental and personal.

I have shared about how this winter was just unbelievable with sickness. I am thinking it is probably due to Zackary going to school and being exposed to many more viruses than he would otherwise have experienced being homeschooled. But, despite my irritation (primarily stemmed from further sleep deprivation) I could not be more happy for him. Zackary loves school in a way that is so rewarding and refreshing to see! In fact, we are coming off of March Break and he is just itching to go back.

So just a little recap of what has been happening around here: Miles turned one last Sunday!!! How on earth is my baby one! It is one of those moments as a parent where you are snapped back to reality; the long days and nights makes the child rearing years (especially during the infant stage) feel so long and drawn out, but then when you sit back for a moment with a clear mind, you realize just how fast time is going. We celebrated with grandparents the first weekend in March. It was lovely. The boys were very excited to spend some one-on-one with both sets of grandparents. The party was probably more for me and the older boys than him haha, but Miles did enjoy his first taste of processed sugar (mmmm, cake!).

And as I mentioned above, we just came off of March break. We didn’t do anything extravagant, we stayed home. However, the boys played soooo well together. I was impressed with how well they communicated and listened to one another. Now, don’t get me wrong, there was friction at times, but overall our home was peaceful. I further enjoyed seeing all the creations that came out of their building collaborations.

We did have one of Zackary’s friends come over with his brothers and momma for a play date. It was neat to see him with his school friend. They are both the oldest of three boys and you could definitely see they get along due to their similarities. What a fun experience :)

Other than that, my days have been filled with cooking, cleaning, laundry and taking care of my very energetic boys! Miles is starting to scale the furniture and attempting to climb the stairs! It’s a fun stage, but also very busy.

Below are some pictures from the week.
Until next time!
