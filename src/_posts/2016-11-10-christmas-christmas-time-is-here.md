I am sure that there are traditions that you have had since you were a child- maybe it is baking Christmas goodies with your mother or grandmother. Christmas shopping with a sibling, watching a specific movie while eating a special meal on Christmas Eve or Christmas Day with loved ones. And as I make mention of these evens a few may come to mind. It is traditions that make us feel connected or warm and fuzzy inside!

There were several traditions that we had for many years while I was growing up: my family would wait until the first snowfall of the season in December to go and pick our Christmas tree; we would have cheese, sausage, crackers and egg knogg on Christmas Eve while watching "It's a Wonderful Life," following Christmas Eve service. And in the morning before we opened our presents we would have a wonderful meal of Mom's Saver (a bread, egg, ham and cheese bake) with orange juice and hash browns. Mmm, good to the last four full! But my favourite thing about the season was how warm and inviting the house always seemed.

I would sit by the tree and look out the window as it snowed or just peer into the glowing lights thinking that in that moment, the world felt right. There was no sadness, anxiety or stress of any kind. I am pretty sentimental when it comes to Christmas. My mother started it- she absolutely loved Christmas while we were growing up. She loved decorating and baking. She would bake goodies for her customers, and us kids would secretly hope that they would not be perfect in one respect or another, so that we could eat them! You see, my mother was a perfectionist (especially when other people were involved), so she could not give away anything less than a perfectly formed treat.

And we have started certain traditions in our home with our children. For instance, we do not partake in Halloween, so that is the day we begin to pull out the Christmas decorations- beginning with the tree! This year, I even bought a pencil Christmas tree for the basement, so that we can enjoy the beauty while in any part of the house! And we have carried over the Mom's Saver to our Christmas Day morning and fondue on New Year's Eve. We also go for walks throughout the season to look at all the lights on neighbours' houses-our kids definitely take after our enthusium for the season. Jonathan and I also have a tree competition (one of us will get coloured lights, the other white lights ) and we will keep count of the trees in the windows. Typically white lights win, so every other year we are a winner.

And with all that being said, the most important event that we celebrate this time of year, is the birth of Jesus Christ. The thought that God sent his only son to come to earth...to be born in the lowliest of places, a manger has always amazed me because he could have come in a palace, which is how people thought it would occur. I love that even in the beginning he continues to establish himself as the Saviour for all men, not just the rich and prominent.

We began a children's novel study last year called, "What Jesus Wants for Christmas." It is really neat-every night there is a present to be opened as a component of Christmas story; for instance, the first night it is about Gabriel (the angel who was sent to deliver the news to Mary that she would become pregnant and give birth to the son of God); the next night, is the story of Mary; the following about Joseph and his response to the events leading to Jesus' birth...and so on until the very last night where there is an empty box with the statement that above everything that has been and will be given at Christmas, the greatest gift we can give is our hearts to the Lord. We all enjoyed taking that time to do it together. I look forward to reading it again this year with the kiddies.

So no matter what your traditions are, I hope that you do take the time to pause and reflect on the birth of Jesus, and the change that his coming brought to the world. What an amazing gift for all of us who receive.
