title: One of Those Days
---

We all have them right? The day where it seems like your kids are going out of their way to make your life miserable. Holy moly, have I had one of those days. (I secretly am blaming the full-moon/hoping that it truly has some ability to affect their behaviour).

It started with having to get all the boys ready and out the door because we had a few errands to run; Zackary needed a new snowsuit and I waited too long last year and there were the spring items in JANUARY! Side note: that has always confused me a smidge bit. Anyways, and then we needed to go grocery shopping because I had NO food in the house for lunch…unless they were fine with eating carrots and apples only. Well, I survived the getting ready part even though it took much longer than I would have liked. And then we arrived at the grocery store. They all still want to sit in the cart; I can get away with it with Timothy still, but there is no way that I can do all three because then I would have no space for the food. This seriously disappoints Zackary lol.

It went pretty well. There was some complaining, but nothing that I couldn’t handle (it was the beginning of the day :) However, then it was lunch prep. And the day kinda began to unravel. Any tips for having your kids wait patiently for the meal when they are hungry. Like, I get it, you want it now, but seriously, I am hungry right now too, but I still have all these meals to prep before I will have a chance to eat! That is probably the area I struggle with the most…demands while I am trying to get a meal ready…as you can probably sense from my tone, I kinda lost my cool once….or twice…oooopsie.

They must know the days that you have many things on your list to accomplish because that is when there seems to be many encounters of strong wills.

Next was gardening. We only have three weeks of leaf pick-up, which includes my flowers and other plants that need to be trimmed or picked. And do you think that they could go ten minutes without being sent for a time out or bickering with each other…if you guessed no, than you are correct. I finally sent them to their rooms to think about a plan that they can implement to stop whining and complaining about not getting what they want. It went pretty well.

Gosh, teaching your children about their heart condition and what it means to truly be sorry is quite the task. And to boot, it is exhausting. I am truly grateful that the Lord is patient with us and brings about change in our own hearts because without asking Him for wisdom and guidance I know I would completely fail at this parenting thing.

Silver lining! It’s Friday, which means daddy is home tomorrow!!!! So one deep breath, or two…well let’s be honest, it will probably be a dozen before bed time, but I have no problem with being pleasantly surprised with how well it can go :)

I hope you are having a fantastic day, and that your weekend proves to be awesome!
