title: A Taco Dip That Is Sure To Please!
---

There is a recipe that has been around for my.whole.life! And it is amazing. I feel like it is something that my daughters-in-law will ask from me one day hehe. It is amazing, and I thought I would share it because it would be a wonderful addition to your Christmas and New Years spread.

Ready to be wowed and shocked with the delicious flavours! Now I should mention that you will want to go back to my blog post from August 31st, entitled “Our Summer” because I list there how I cook my meat. With that being said…here we go.

**Taco Dip:**

Preheat oven to 350 degrees. I use a 9X13 pan. Cook time is 25-30 minutes or until the cheese is bubbling.

Bottom layer: homemade refried beans. I am attaching the link to the website where I found the recipe. Seriously, a game changer over here. I have only tried making it with canned beans, but I fully intend to try it from dry one day.
(https://moneysavingmom.com/2012/03/how-to-make-homemade-refried-beans.html). It may take a little longer than buying a can of refried beans, but I guarantee that you will not regret it!

Second layer: homemade crockpot taco meat (again, August 31st post).

Third Layer: salsa. I use PC extra chunky because well, I like the chunky, but like most recipes, you use what your famjam would like.

TopLayer: old cheddar cheese (my favourite brand is Armstrongs). Be as generous as you desire. We enjoy a lot of cheese, and you really want to have enough that it covers the whole dish.

And that’s it! We service it with some nacho chips and Franks hot sauce. We like to personalize the heat over here :)

Enjoy my friends!
