title: Summer of Sorrow
---

2017 has been a roller coaster of a year. There have been so many amazing things that have taken place: the birth of Miles, the continued success of Timothy in all his speech assessments, Zackary being homeschooled, amazing job opportunities for Jonathan, and the list goes on. But there have been great losses to. The greatest being the passing of our niece Abigail.

My sister Sarah found she was pregnant right before I had Miles, and was due in the fall. This was her third pregnancy (she had miscarried in the fall). We were all very excited and praying for the little one. It was part of our daily prayers, especially with the boys, Zackary would ALWAYS pray for auntie Sarah's baby.

In the midst of her pregnancy, they were finishing up their paperwork for their green cards to live in the States. In mid-June, they were going to be coming for a visit and traveling to Montreal to finish up. Their little guy, Sebastian, would go between myself and my parents while they were away. Everything was planned, scheduled and good to go. And then Sarah mentioned to me after church that she was spotting. I told her not to worry about it, that I had bleeding with all my pregnancies, but that I would go to the hospital and have it looked in to. She and Fraser agreed and went to the hospital later that afternoon.

Everything from there seems like a blur. They performed emergency surgery on Sarah to help her save the pregnancy because her cervix was thinning already (she was close to 20 weeks). After that, she spent three days in the hospital and was sent home to be on bedrest. Sarah was going to stay with my parents while Fraser returned to Kentucky for work. He would make his way down on many weekends until week 32 when they would travel back to the States to have Abigail.

Shortly after the procedure, Sarah went to London to see a specialist. It was during this appointment that she was given all the risk factors of having a premature baby, and found out that the reason for the miscarriage and advanced thinning of her cervix was due to scar tissue from her c-section with Sebastian.

The information was daunting, but we all talked about it and came up with a plan to make it to week 32. We were so focused and believing God for this that when Sarah went into labour on June 19th, we were all, I think, in a state of shock. She went to emerg the morning of June 19th and they gave her a shot to stop labour. It worked, and she returned home, but later that evening she went back. Sarah was experiencing more contractions and from what she has told me, it was active labour.

I received the phone call late that night, that Sarah had given birth to a baby girl, that they had named her Abigail. My heart was broken. My heart broke for my sister. I hated that I was not able to be there to comfort her and to encourage her. My heart broke knowing that my brother-in-law was not able to be there to see his little girl be born, and to support his wife in during labour. My heart broke knowing that we would not be able to know and enjoy Abigail until we meet again in heaven.

Sarah called me the next morning, and we had one of our most emotional phone calls. I don't remember too much of the call now, but I do remember her apologizing for crying. I reassured her, that she could cry all she wanted, Lord knew, I had. She told me that she had decided to keep Abigail in the room with her until Fraser was able to come (he was arriving that day). I asked her if she wanted me to come and meet Abby. Jonathan agreed to watch the older boys. I ran around, threw some clothes on, and out the door I went.

I tried to brace myself for how tiny and dainty little Abby would be, but there was no way to truly prepare myself. There she was, a little bigger than my hand: she had mommy's ears and looked like her daddy. What a pretty little thing. I told her that I would have rocked the auntie scene-I would have shown her how to do some amazing updos, braided her hair, bestowed on her the love of Anne of Green Gables and Pride and Prejudice. But most of all, that I loved her. That I look forward to giving her the biggest hug when we meet again. Truth be told, I did not want to put her down. I love holding babies to begin with, but knowing that would be the only time I would hold her, just made me want to prolong the moment...it was like my brain wanted to pretend that this was not good-bye.

A few days later we had the funeral service. And at the site, we laid a pretty pink rose on her white coffin.

It all seems like a dream; as if one day I will wake-up and she will be here smiling at me. So I hold to the truth, that she is with my Jesus now. That she is so loved and full of joy walking, and learning and being in the presence of our Lord and Saviour. That our reunion will be awesome because it will be place where there is no pain, no sadness, no darkness, no evil and no good-byes. We get eternity to learn about and love Abigail, and that is our blessing in the midst of all the pain and tears.

We love you Abby. We praise the Lord for your life, and are thankful that your death is not the end of the story.
