I remember when Jonathan and I had Zackary, him asking me what I thought my favourite age was going to be; my response, was that I did not think I would be able to choose because I loved everything up to that point. And that still remains the truth- I did not even mind getting up in the middle of the night countless times because it meant I was FINALLY a mom. The moment that I had dreamed about since I was three was here.

I will, however, admit that the comments coming from Zackary these days are absolutely adorable! He will be four in a month (which is just ridiculous) and he is just killing the sweet talk. For instance, the other day he presented a list to me, and when I inquired about the contents, his response was that it is a todo list for when he married me. I smiled and explained that mommy was already married to daddy, so we could not get married. He began to cry, so I sat down next to him, and told him that little boys do not marry their mommy's, BUT he could marry a lady who is very much like mommy. That seemed to comfort him a little.

And then yesterday while I was making lunch in the kitchen, he was colouring and said, "Angel, would you please come over here and count these markers with me." I only vaguely caught what he said, and he clearly wanted me to know what he said, "Mommy, did you hear that I called you an angel?" I smiled, "Oh Hun, that is precious." I thought that would be the end, but it wasn't haha. "Mommy, I called you because you are beautiful like the Angels in heaven." He then explained how I should have wings and live in heaven too :) He knows that I am by no means as beautiful and majestic, but gosh, how he made me feel so special. And I needed that moment.

God is amazing at how he knows what we need and when we need it. Staying at home and constantly being on duty can play on your emotions. The past few weeks have been so busy and the boys are getting more busy every day. There are moments I feel like I must not be doing something right, or there has to be something I am missing with parenting, and then they declare their love and adoration, and I think, ah, now there is a moment I can cling onto that will get me through a few days hahaha.

So as much as I have loved every stage, I have to admit, I am loving the sweet talk and adoration from my Zackary.
