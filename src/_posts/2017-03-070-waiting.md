title: Waitingâ€¦
---

There are many things that require our patience in life, and the newest that I am experiencing, is waiting for our third little boy to come.

I am not accustomed to waiting- Zackary was born a month before his due date, and Timothy two weeks. So the fact that I am already three days overdue is just amazing. I know that timing is based on baby, but to think that I would be over, did not entirely cross my mind. I even have an appointment this afternoon to discuss the possibility of induction. I have had to resolve that thankfully, he will be here soon.

But waiting, geesh. I am pretty good to get through the days (probably because I know that life is going to be changing again, and routines will have to reworked and figured out), but the constant questions about whether or not I am labouring can be hard. However, it just shows other people's excitement too. I have remained calm, which as I have shared before, is not always a strength of mine .

That is what has been going on in the Bennett household...waiting for baby in the midst of our days full of homeschooling, laundry, cleaning, cooking and playing. I will keep y'all posted.

And my apologies for the gap of posts. For whatever reason, my blog was not allowing me to post anything. Thankfully, it appears to be fine now!
