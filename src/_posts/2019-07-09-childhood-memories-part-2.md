title: "Childhood Memories: Part 2"

So did you think about anything that you and your siblings did as kids that now make you wonder, “what were we thinking?” I have another one for you :) I am sure many parents would shriek in fear over this next one (I know I would if I saw any of my little men doing this): jumping off the shed roof. You heard me, wether it was leaves or snow, we would pile said items up against the shed and then climb up the latter into the attic of the garage, and then we would gleefully launch ourselves off. Honestly, we had such a blast doing this. And we only stopped when the roof started cave in…at least we had the sense to stop it then :)

And as to not reveal all our secrets we jumped off a bridge! Yup, I said that, a bridge. Not to far from where were live now, my brother, sister and some of our cousins would meet up at a beach that had a bridge joining the two sides (they since have removed it….could be they got tired of the liability of young children jumping off of it). We would climb over the rail and jump. Now, I wasn’t scared after I did it the first time, and I think that is only because we had just learned in swimming lessons how to successfully jump in such a way that our feet would float up… you know, so you wouldn’t break your feet or legs. It was pretty shallow too. Kids definitely do the darnedest things!

Until next time! xoxxo
