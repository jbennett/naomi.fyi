title: Christmas Time is Here!
---

I have mentioned before that I am a pretty big Christmas enthusiast. And I am not kidding when I say that :) Right from the 31st of October through to February, I have my decorations up. The bright Christmas lights and the cool air, warm my heart. The beauty of it all, reminds me of the wonderful Christmases I shared with my family growing-up.

I didn't grow-up in a home with a surplus of money; my parents worked very hard to provide myself and my three siblings. (My mom went back to work to pay for our braces…a beautiful smile was important to her, and I thank her for it!) But Christmas was amazing in my house. We had our traditions of stockings, and wonderful Christmas breakfast with Momsaver, hash browns, orange juice and eggnog. Some years there would even be the option of cinnamon rolls! So what am I rambling on about….well, that is what I remember; I remember spending time with my family all together, no work, no interruptions, just me and my family. There was closeness and harmony. A day where everyone just relaxed and enjoyed each other. Why wouldn’t I want to live with that feeling of closeness for almost half the year?!

And the other aspect of Christmas that meant more to me was the remembrance of how God sent his son Jesus Christ to earth, to grow, live, serve and eventually give his life for me. It brings me to tears to think that Jesus left heaven to become flesh and give himself to us; that we, having put our faith in Christ, would be blameless and holy in God’s eyes. There is nothing on this earth that I could ever be given that would top that!

What about you? What memories does the Christmas season bring too mind for you?

I know it is early for some of you, but, I hope that this season brings you closer to family and that you create memories that will last a lifetime!

Until next time.
