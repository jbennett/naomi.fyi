title: The Day Our Son was Born
---

On March 11, 2017 at 11:57am our third son was born: Miles Samuel. He weighed 8 pounds 2 ounces and was 20.5 inches long. What a beautiful sight to see! I mentioned earlier that I was induced, so it was a new experience from my previous labours. If I told you that I wasn't nervous, I would be lying. I think it was because I had no idea what to expect.

I was hooked up to the drip at 8am and probably around 8:30 I began to have consistent contractions. We called my midwife around 9, and told her not to rush, but gave all the particulars about how far apart the contractions were and so on. I have had the same wonderful midwife for all my pregnancies, but Miles was the first birth that she was able to be there. I was beyond excited for her to be present.

Because I was induced, an O.B (the same that delivered my oldest) had to deliver the baby. I remember him coming into the room and stating that he would come back in when I felt the need to push. So, at 11:50am when I had the urge, he made another appearance. I really liked his nature, but was not entirely impressed when he told me not to begin pushing until he came back dressed...holy molly!!! Those few minutes (well it may have only been a minute), but geesh, it felt super long. I even think that I may have pushed a little because my midwife went into position until he came back :)

And after only SEVEN MINUTES there he was. The perfect mix between our older two boys. It, once again, was love at first sight. I remember thinking how blessed I was, how truly honoured I felt that God bestowed on us the responsibility of raising another boy.

Yet another blessing was that, unlike our other two guys, Miles did not have to be brought to the special nursery. Jonathan and I got to hold and snuggle him for the seven hours that we were in the hospital room. I do remember not wanting to put him down-his face was just so kissable!!!

The weeks to follow were wonderful and painful and exhausting all wrapped into one delicately tied package. Our oldest, Zackary, was sooo in love with his little brother. My goodness, ask him to help in any way that involved doing something for Miles and he was all over it. Timothy, our middle guy, did really well for the first monthly until, I think, he noticed that Miles was here to stay. Then it became an absolute nightmare at bedtime-he would scream at a level I would not think possible...and all because mom was not able to do it. Naturally, one of Miles' feeds would take place when bedtime began. I would of course go in and give hugs and kisses the moment that I had settled Miles, but to Timothy, it was not the same thing. That whole fiasco continued until around month three, and now, he has begun to take part in Miles' life too; he will sing him songs, try and assure him if he is upset...just being such a good big brother.

We were both so thankful that I was able to nurse Miles. The first thing after they examined him was to check his palate. As you may remember from previous blogs, Timothy had a cleft palate so I pumped to feed him. When we were told that his palate was fully formed, I had tears. What a blessing to be able to bond with my son as opposed to having the focus be on pumping, feeding and repeat. I loved being able to give Timothy breast milk, but I truly felt like a cow hooked up to a machine. This way I at least got to snuggle my boy in the process. He nursed quite well, but after a week I started to have fairly large blisters and each feeding was really painful. I thought that maybe it was due to hormones that my nipples were more sensitive (TMI, I know :) So in week two, I called my midwife absolutely bawling-I dreaded every feeding. She instructed me to pump for 24 hours and see if there was an improvement in the condition of my chest and if not, to call the health unit to talk to their lactation consultants. I went in to see one the next day.

It was at that time, that it was confirmed that Miles had a tongue tie. They looked at my form when feeding him, his latch etc. Everything was just as they would expect, but with the tongue tie, my nipple was being pinched and held against the hard palate, producing the large cuts.

My midwives gave me a special steroid cream to heal it, but with how often the feeds were, it was doing nothing. Finally after three week, and feeling like I was going to die, my midwife told me about two doctors that performed laser surgery to eliminate the tie. One was in London and the other in Windsor. They couldn't see me in London until five weeks later. I hung up that phone and began bawling. I didn't think there would be much of me left in that area after five more weeks. So I spoke with Jonathan and asked him if he would be alright with us driving to Windsor. He said yes. I called and they had an appointment for us the next morning!

We were so relieved when we got there. The doctor examined Miles' mouth and saw that he also had a lip tie, which further restricted movement. The procedure only took about five minutes. And we had stretches that we needed to do for the next three weeks, but thank the Lord, that is all history. He nurses so well, and I was completely healed up by month three. It is such a peaceful and enjoyable experience now.

He is now six months and is so social. My goodness, he just loves to see what everyone is up to. He greets everyone with a smile and loves being part in whatever you are doing. He was sleeping through the night, but with this growth spurt my longer snoozes have been significant;y reduced.

On that note, I am going to head to bed :) With the hours being numbered, I wanna make sure I get some decent beauty rest.

Until next time!
