There are many different ways that we celebrate the coming of a new year-for some it is full of celebrations and anticipation and for others, well, it can seem quite daunting. I tend to enter in with the anticipation that wonderful things are going to take place. And I will admit, this year I have had to cling to that despite all the awful things going on in the world around us.

How about you? Is your year full of anticipation or dread?

I have mentioned in a post before that I have struggled with fear; and with a world that tends to feed us news that invokes fear, it can be hard to escape. However, in a conversation with a friend the other day, she reminded me that a new year is like a fresh slate. And that fresh slate needs to focused on the Lord, His greatness and glory.

It is with a heavenly focus, that I have had to revisit my thoughts on new year's resolutions. I stopped making them when I entered high school. Why? Let's just say that I saw people making these resolution that always seemed to end in failure. The thought of failing year after year was ridiculous to me. But, what I neglected was that a resolution can be more than outrageous goals that are abandoned (because they are outrageous) rather, it is also a reflection on the year past and ways to improve on the year ahead. And that is something that is needed.

We, as a culture, need to be more introspective; we need to be properly critical of ourselves-analyzing the decisions we have made (the success or failure of those decisions) so that we can proceed in both short term and long term plans. If we cannot do that, than I believe we are setting ourselves up for a life of unachievable goals.

So, I encourage you to sit down, take a pen and piece of paper and quietly reflect on 2016. Playfully consider, the areas that the Lord would have you change and bring before Him in 2017. What a wonderful way to start the new year! With His guidance and influence.

Let's greet 2017 with excitement and anticipation :)
