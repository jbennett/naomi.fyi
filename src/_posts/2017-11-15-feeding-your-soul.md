title: Feeding Your Soul
---

Well, it is mid-November. And on this cold dreary day, I am trying to shake myself our of a grumpy mood. My older two guys have been pushing each other’s buttons today, and I find that just works momma into a bit of tizzy.

Now, thankfully, they are playing outside nicely right now. So I decided to jack the worship tunes and feed my spirit while it is quiet. It is something that I do not do nearly enough. As I mentioned in my last post, I am in survival mode. I don’t wanna be; I don’t want to just make it to the end of each day in one piece. I want to have joy, and to have it abundantly. I want to smile and keep my peace in the midst of a two year old meltdown. I want to rest in my Jesus when my oldest is making his rocket sounds in the house (even though he has been told five hundred thousand times) that is for the outdoors. I want to be listening and hear the the Holy Spirit speak to me while I scrub those toilets clean. I want to view my household (my little ones and my tasks) as my mission field: to do everything as if I was doing it for my creator (Colossians 3:23).

Do you ladies relate? Do you ever feel like the weight of all your responsibilities has dug you a hole and you know you need to get out of there, but you are so far down that you can’t even figure out how to get out. What does that look like? That’s where I have found myself lately. And when I get to that point, all the ways that my spirit is fed and rejuvenated are the things that I tend to run from (weird...). I am not sure if I am alone, but I am forcing myself to just GET OUT of there because I don’t want to be buried.

Here I go, baby steps. Pushing past the fatigue, and the lack of desire to move. Because I know that my Jesus hasn’t moved...He is still here, wanting me.

So ladies, go have your soul fed by some awesme worship. I am choosing to thrive in the midst of it all!

Here is a suggestion....my favourite song right now:
