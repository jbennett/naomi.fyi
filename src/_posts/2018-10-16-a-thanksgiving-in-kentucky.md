title: A Thanksgiving in Kentucky
---

We very rarely travel. It is just not something that either of us really grew up doing and then there was always the issue of money in the early years of our marriage, so we never made it part of our relationship.

However, when Jonathan’s parents moved up North and now my sister living south...exceptions are made.

So we decided that we would go south for our Canadian thanksgiving because then Zackary wouldn’t miss many days of school and the weather would still be good for traveling. This was our first venture that way.

I had wanted to go last year, but Miles being under one and hating car rides didn’t fill me with warm and fuzzies about our way there and back haha. Now it seemed like the right timing.

It is funny though, preparing for the trip. It seems like so much time and energy goes into packing and making sure that you don’t leave your house a disaster, that tensions are super high! At least they are for me. And this time too, with making sure that I had enough toys for Miles to play with, and activities for the boys to do in the car…it is no small thing to entertain and keep occupied an 18 month old, 3 and 6 year old! I did feel like a champ a few times though when my hubby asked me if I remembered some items or even the toll for the bridge and I responded with “yes.” He was pretty sweet though when he declared, “of course we do, you planned everything.”

Sooo despite my long hours of prep and smidgen bit of stress related to it, off we went. And we were doing well until Detroit! It is funny because my sister and brother-in-law as well as a few other people told us to wait until after we had passed through Detroit to stop. And so that was our plan; we rationed the boys water, we decided that the boys would stay in the pjs until we made that stop so that we wouldn’t get stuck in rush hour morning traffic etc. But, you cannot plan for an hour detour! So before we finally could see the end in sight, we stopped at a McDonalds in Detroit. It was actually perfect timing because that is when the boys stated that they had to pee. So pee break, out of the pjs and away we go. We stopped two other times, one to eat and one more for a pee break before we were there.

Everything was pretty smooth sailing until the very last hour….I was ready to be done and the boys were starting to annoy each other a little bit….so we were just done. Pressing onward, we arrived after ten hours!

And there, my beautiful sister had broccoli soup (which I do have to get the recipe from her) and salad. A perfect meal after a long day of travel. Ooooh yes, and we went to town on the water :)

We had such a lovely visit. We were able to go to the splash pad because, unlike what it was North, the temperature there did not go below 86 degrees during the day. (Upside, my tan is back :) We also took the kiddos to the Louisville zoo! What a wonderful experience; I was completely blown away by the size of the rhino…oh my goodness-no wonder in wildlife those things can do some damage….wow! It was cute because Miles was content to sit in his stroller while we looked at the giraffes, rhino, and lion, but the moment we entered the gorilla cave, he could not get out fast enough!!! He was enthralled with this giant of an animal. He kept calling it a dog, which is what he calls every animal at this point, but it was particularly hilarious just based on the size of the gorilla. The boys all watched in amazement as the gorilla ate his salad (not even kidding, they had huge heads of lettuce, tomatoes and cauliflower). It was funny to note that they didn’t care for the seeds of the tomatoes, and observation that Jonathan made. The gorilla bit into the tomatoes and brushed out the seeds before consuming.

I also loved the polar bar and the sea lion…the sea lion came right up to the glass that we were looking in on. What a magnificent imagination God has to create all these unique and amazing creatures.

And to wrap up our trip, Sunday we were able to attend their church. It was such a great trip. And now that we have done it, I don’t have the same reservations about the length of the trip. And honestly, I think the fact that the kiddos knew we were going to see uncle Fraser and aunt Sarah made everything bearable :)

But goodbyes are always so difficult. I really don’t like them. Especially when it is going to be months and months before we see them again. I just wanna throw out a huge thank you to Apple for making FaceTime…without it, the distance would be awful. I am not a fan, but the fact that my sweet nephew knows my voice and face from only physically being with me a few times a year makes my heart just swell with happiness.

I do have a few highlights from the trips of what the kiddos did or said: Sebastian on more than one occasion called Zackary his best friend; Sebastian refused his parents assistants a few times and said he wanted auntie Nomie to come with him :) The boys all running together and laughing. Timothy exclaiming with excitement every time we would go up, down or around on a hill (I didn’t not realize Kentucky was so mountainous). And finally, Timothy thinking we were calling Ohio, the pile-took me a while to figure out why he was asking if we had gone through “the pile.” Lol, gotta love children!

So there you have it! Our trip to the South was very pleasurable and we look forward to our next trip.

Until next time,
Naomi
