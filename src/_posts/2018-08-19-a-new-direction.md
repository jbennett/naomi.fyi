title: A New Direction
---

Have you ever been thrown into something simply because of the stage of life you are in? That is where I am right now.

The last year has been a developing year in many ways- learning to be a mom of three for one :) But the biggest change and all consuming area has been my boys stomachs. You may chuckle there, but I am not kidding...my boys eat, and eat and after they are done eating, they eat some more. I am not using hyperbole AT ALL. Miles is now even in on the action, absolutely squealing with delight whenever the fridge door opens hahha. I bought a huge bushel of peaches yesterday from the Farmer’s Market and left a few in the box on the floor and realized I cannot no longer do that because Miles helped himself twice today.

So where I am going with this. Well, about a year ago I started watching vlogs on YouTube about crockpot, freezer meals, and ultimately how to cook when you have larger families. I know, there are only five of us, but the way the boys eat, there might as well be eight to ten. As a result I have been doing what I affectionately call, Big Cooks with friends. It is amazing because I get to spread my administrator wings by planning the meals and getting all the ingredients ready for the day, as well satisfying my extroverted personality.

And to be honest, my ten year old younger self would be laughing hysterically right now because I HATED cooking. Cooking was a way to sustain life, it was not an enjoyable process either in preparing or consuming. I know that sounds terrible and really, unfortunate, because when you think about how many functions are centred around food, the numbers are uncalculable. And don’t get my wrong, I would eat anything and enjoy it, but I didn’t like the planning and prepping and executing of meals.

What started out as necessity for freeing myself up to spend more time with my boys as well as for health benefits (finding recipes that used no sugar or preservatives) has quickly become a passion of mine. The more that I do it, the more that I have realized that I shouldn’t keep these recipes to myself. If I am loving it and finding that it relieves the pressure of having to figure out what we are going to eat on a daily basis, than I am sure there are many of you out there too. I would love to eventually have about a month or two stored in the freezer, but that would mean that we would have to get yet another freezer, and I am not quite ready to do that lol.

I should mention too, that my husband had very particular thoughts on food (I don’t want to use the word picky, but for me it was...no onions, no peppers, no mushrooms and texture is as big deal). And I am only telling you this because he has been praising my cooking more and more, and absolutely looking forward to dinner hour, which has not always been the case :)

So here is one of our favourites:

**Cranberry Chicken:**

- 4 lbs of chicken breast (you can use whatever cut you like, I tend towards boneless skinless chicken breasts)
- 3 medium apples cut into wedges (the sweeter the better here, because you are going to have the tartness of the cranberries)
- juice of two lemons (added only on the day of. So if you freeze the meal first, add in on the day you put it in the crockpot)
- 2 TBS of honey
- 2 cans (15 0z) or bags of cranberries (I have used both and my preference is towards the fresh cranberries because I like to limit the sugar levels....BUT both taste amazing)
- 2 TBS of arrowroot flour (also only to be added the day of cooking)

Mix all ingredients together and place in the crockpot. Cook on low for 6-8 hours or high for 4-5. I suggest that if you freeze the meal first that you cook it on low for 8-10 hours. Also, just a tip if you are a beginner at freezer meals, always make sure that your meat is at the top of the bag, so that when you put it in the crockpot on that morning, the meat will end up on the bottom.

I hope you give this a shot! I will be sharing more in the weeks to come. Food is such a major component of every day, so enjoying it as well as getting the best nutrients from pure ingredients is a big deal for me. My kiddos are at a major stages of every aspect of development both physically and mentially, and with all the sugar and preservatives in so many foods, I want to help them develop excellent eating habits, that will benefit them in making wise choices for their health and development in the future.

As they say, BON APPETIT!
