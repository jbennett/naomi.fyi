title: Zackary is Growing Up
---

This year is the first time that we really have seen our kids participate in plays/music festivals. Prior years, they just felt too young, which typically means lack of focus. But this year, Zackary really wanted to be at the night performance for the school Christmas concert as well as in our churches Christmas play. I somewhat reluctantly agreed (not because I don’t like Christmas plays, but because like many things, when your kids are committed, so are you :) Additionally, I don’t know if this is an all kids thing or a young boy thing, but it takes a lot energy for them to focus for long periods of time. It’s exhausting for them.

That being said, it was so great to see him up front singing and doing the actions. I was very impressed with all the kids (grades 2-4); they sang beautifully, and smiled at all the parents and grandparents. I am honestly surprised that I didn’t get all choked up and teary. There was my boy on-point-it truly is amazing the difference in their character and attention from SK to grade 1.

It made me think about how other times I may have misjudged situations incorrectly. Really, how will we ever know if we don’t try, or stretch ourselves to see if we are capable of more than we thought, or others thought of us. It was a teaching moment for me-I am really going to make an effort to not keep my children in a stage because I think they aren’t ready for it…if I let them take baby steps and they have success in it, then we will continue further; however, if the opposite takes place then we will just take that baby step back and try again another time.

Are you with me? Do you think that you have kept your child in a particular stage because of their development, or because of you? And don’t get me wrong, I believe that parents have great insight into their children (whether toddler or adult)…but may we not stereotype our kids that holds them back from growing as a person.

Happy Almost Christmas! Until next time…
