title: When You Can't Change It
---

I am sure there have been moments and situations in your life where all you wanted to do was change some or all aspects of the circumstance. I have found myself in a few lately. And as much as I hate to admit it, I put my brain into overtime to try and figure out what I could do to solve the issue. When in reality, and in many cases, it is not mine to fix. Now, don't get me wrong, when you are responsible for state of a relationship or situation, I believe you should own it and account for any wrongs committed- I am speaking to the relationships and situations that have gone in a direction you don't want, and it has absolutely nothing to do with anything you said or did.

That position of, "how did we get here," is where I have landed. It is the position where you honestly don't know what you could have done differently. If I can be candid, it sucks! It sucks because I have found that so many times, who I am and how I view myself, can be linked to these relationships or situations. And as I get older I am realizing that, that is wrong. I cannot find my fulfillment in anyone or anything other than the Lord.

When you become stripped of all those elements that defined you, whether you realized you were defined by them or not, it can put you into tailspin; leaving you with the feeling of rejection that is so strong that you almost don't know anything about yourself any more. It is a dark and awful place to be. And one of the reasons it is so awful is because it is devoid of our source of life; it is devoid of what it is that fills us; it is devoid of the only one who can heal; it is devoid of the son of God.

And what I am learning is that it is only until we realign ourselves to be in tune and in focus with Jesus that these pains, these rejections, these feeling of inadequacy begin to fade.

The position I have found myself in, has led me to a book by Lysa Terkeurst, "Living Loved when you Feel Less than Leftout and Lonley." And the one chapter that I just finished demonstrated the improtance of living like you are loved because you are- you are loved by the Lord! And when you know this and live this, and choose to live loved, all the rejection that is felt, or maybe intentioanal from someone, pales in comparison to that love. What a beautiful picture.

So where to go from here? To a place where even if I cannot change those relationships, even if I feel completely leftout and alienated, even if I am at moments completely alone, I need to remind myself, that I am not. I am not ever alone, I am not ever leftout of God's circle, and I am not ever excluded from His love. The challenge: to have my spirit and flesh both align with that truth!

And with that, I hope and pray you all have a very Merry Christmas, filled with the truth, that Christ came so that we could be saved and fulfilled by Him and only Him.

Blessings to you in the remainder of this year, and in the year to follow.
