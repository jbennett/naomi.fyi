title: Our Summer
---

It’s amazing how much more freedom a mommy feels like she has after her baby is one. I was able to get out of the house more often with the boys this year since I wasn’t as restricted to feeding and napping schedules (Timothy no longer naps and Miles is down to one and is flexible as to when it takes place). And when you have three little men with loads of energy, you really want to get out and have plenty of opportunities for exercise.

As I mentioned earlier, we spent many hours at a local campground-their pool was amazing and we found that during the week (typically Tuesday-Friday) the pool would be empty, especially early afternoon. Not gonna lie, I am rocking a pretty decent tan :) Living near the water is lovely to because we can go for a quick dip and then head back home.

In addition to fun in the sun, we established some summer favourites at meal time. One being TACOS. I found this absolutely amazing DIY taco seasoning, and...you guessed it, I can do it all in my slow cooker haha.

Here is our awesome Crockpot Taco Meat Recipe:

- 1-2 LBS lean ground beef (TBH, I do 3-4 lbs and then double the seasonings)
- 1 TBS Chili powder (2 TBS if doubled)
- 1 tsp cumin (2 tsp)
- 1 tsp sea salt (2 tsp)
- 1 tsp black pepper (2 tsp)
- 1/2 tsp corriander (1 tsp)
- 1/2 tsp dried oregano (1 tsp)
- 1/2 tsp garlic powder (1 tsp)
- 1/2 tsp onion powder (1 tsp)
- 1/4 tsp paprika (1/2 tsp)
- 1/4 tsp crushed red peppers (1/2 tsp).

If the meat is fresh and thawed, cook for 4 hours on low. If frozen, cook on low for 8 hours. Break- up the meat throughout the cooking process, if possible.

Our favourite is to make taco salad with tomatoes, mango, hot bell peppers, salsa, hot sauce and sour cream. It is delicious! This is such a great summer meal because all your fresh produce is in season. We are now reaping the benefits of our garden in that respect: fresh tomatoes off the vine, yum, yum, yum.

Hope you try and enjoy the taste of the meat...honestly, I don’t think you will ever want to purchase a store bought mix again! Not only is it less expensive, the flavour is so much better.

Happy eating!
