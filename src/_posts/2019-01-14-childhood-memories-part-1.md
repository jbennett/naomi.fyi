title: "Ahhh, Childhood Memories: Part 1"
---

I love reminiscing with my siblings about our childhood; it is so much fun to talk about our lives before we had responsibility (in the sense of being parents, owning homes etc). And furthermore, it is hilarious when things are revealed to our parents‚Ä¶watching their faces is priceless. Now don‚Äôt get the wrong idea, we were not deceitful or bad mannered, but we still did things that, well, were dangerous‚Ä¶.oh the nativity of a child.

I will give you a few examples over the next few posts. When we were younger, we played a game called alligator (why we called it alligator, I don‚Äôt really know); Sarah and I shared a room and had twin beds that sat parallel with each other, so one of us would lay between the two beds and would try and catch either of the other individuals; when the individual was caught, they became the alligator. Sounds relatively fine, right? Well, I didn‚Äôt say the super ‚Äúclever‚Äù part yet‚Ä¶the person laying in the middle would have a baton in hand and would try and wrap it around the jumpers legs to have them crash down onto the bed. Now, the funny thing is, I don‚Äôt remember any one of us getting hurt. Seriously, maybe my brother and sister could attest to it, but I don‚Äôt remember that. We loved this game, I remember playing it until our batons eventually were broken‚Ä¶mmm, may be they broke one time while playing the game hahah.

What about you? Did you and your siblings ever engage in any dangerously fun childhood games? I have more coming your way over the next few posts üôÇ

Until next time. Xo
