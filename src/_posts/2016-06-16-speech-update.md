title: "Timothy Update: Speech"
---

Timothy had his first speech assessment on Wednesday. I went solo with Timothy, which ended up being a really good thing since I did not know what to expect from the meeting.

The specialist (Ann) asked me questions about the different words that he is saying/milestones that he has reached. Obviously, at this point she cannot rely on getting her information from him :) He played really well while we were speaking. She said that from what she can see he is actively engaging in his play and with those around him, which is all part of communication. She said for future we could always bring in videos of him too, so she can observe his development...because we all know that sometimes children do not want to perform on the spot!

Based on the words that he is saying, he is a little bit ahead of schedule, which was extremely wonderful to hear! She encouraged me not to compare him to children his age as he has only been able to hear properly for the past six months. She also indicated that over the next six months we will see even more of an explosion of words from him, whereas children with regular hearing tend to slow down a little bit at this age bracket. Ann did ask if we noticed an increase in his speech after the tubes were put in, which I acknowledged as he only said momma before the surgery.

So all that to say, HE IS DOING AWESOME! We had a little praise party on the way home. We are so thankful to the Lord.
